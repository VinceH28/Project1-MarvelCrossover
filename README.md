# CodeVengers/Project-1

As Marvel fans and novice programmers, we designed an application that allows users to research Marvel Superheroes and find out where these heroes can be seen in action. Our application, titled Marvel Overlaps, merges the worlds of the Marvel Comics and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Users can search for their favorite heroes and find out their biographical information, number of comic and series appearances, and the Marvel movies they have been featured in.

## Application Criteria:
* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Use at least two server-side APIs.
* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Be responsive.
* Have a polished UI.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
## Presentation Criteria:
* Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application
* Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
* Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
* Demo: Show your stuff!
* Directions for Future Development
* Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository
